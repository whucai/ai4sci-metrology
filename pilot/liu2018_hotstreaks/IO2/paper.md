The hot streak, loosely defined as winning begets more winnings, highlights a specific period
during which an individual’s performance is substantially higher than her typical performance. While widely debated in sports1–3 , gambling4–7 , and financial markets8–10 over the
past several decades, little is known if hot streaks apply to individual careers. Here, building on rich literature on lifecycle of creativity11–23 , we collected large-scale career histories
of individual artists, movie directors and scientists, tracing the artworks, movies, and scientific publications they produced. We find that, across all three domains, hit works within a
career show a high degree of temporal regularity, each career being characterized by bursts
of high-impact works occurring in sequence. We demonstrate that these observations can be
1

explained by a simple hot-streak model we developed, allowing us to probe quantitatively the
hot streak phenomenon governing individual careers, which we find to be remarkably universal across diverse domains we analyzed: The hot streaks are ubiquitous yet unique across
different careers. While the vast majority of individuals have at least one hot streak, hot
streaks are most likely to occur only once. The hot streak emerges randomly within an individual’s sequence of works, is temporally localized, and is unassociated with any detectable
change in productivity. We show that, since works produced during hot streaks garner significantly more impact, the uncovered ho t streaks fundamentally drives the collective impact
of an individual, ignoring which leads us to systematically over- or under-estimate the future
impact of a career. These results not only deepen our quantitative understanding of patterns
governing individual ingenuity and success, they may also have implications for decisions
and policies involving predicting and nurturing individuals with lasting impact.
A creative career is often defined by the sequence of works an individual produces at various
stages14, 15, 20, 22–25 . According to the Matthew effect12, 26–28 , victories bring reputation and recognition that can translate into tangible assets which in turn help bring future victories. This school of
thought supports the existence of hot streaks in a career, which is also consistent with the innovation literature showing that peak performance clusters in time, typically occurring around mid
career11, 14, 24 . Yet, on the other hand, the random impact rule uncovered in arts13, 24 and sciences13, 23
predicts the opposite: The best works occur randomly within a career, primarily driven by productivity. Following this school of thought, works after a major breakthrough are not affected by
what preceded them, supporting the viewpoint of regression toward the mean. The two divergent

2

schools of thought, together with the consequential nature of this question to individual ingenuity
and success, raise a fundamental question: Do hot streaks exist in creative careers?

To answer this question, we collected systematically large-scale datasets recording career
histories of individual artists, movie directors and scientists (Supplementary Information S1), allowing us to explore across three major domains involving human creativity. The first dataset (D1 )
consists of auction records curated from online auction databases, allowing us to reconstruct career histories of 3,480 artists through the sequence of works they each produced, together with
impacts of the artworks, approximated by hammer prices in auctions20 . D2 contains profiles of
6,233 movie directors recorded in the IMDB database, each career being represented by the sequence of movies he/she directed. Since metrics that quantify impacts of a movie correlate closely
with each other29 , here we use the IMDB ratings to measure the goodness of a movie. Finally,
our third dataset (D3 ) includes publication records of 20,040 individual scientists through a largescale name disambiguation effort that combined the Web of Science and Google Scholar datasets
(Supplementary Information S1.3). The impact of each paper is measured by citations garnered
after 10 years of its publication17, 21, 23, 30 , C10 . Since hammer price (D1 ) and C10 (D3 ) both follow
fat-tailed distributions (Fig. S3), here we take the logarithmic of these measures, i.e., log(price)
and log(C10 ) to approximate the goodness of an artwork and scientific publication.

Motivated by Merton’s theory of multiples12, 31 , we start by investigating the timing of the
three most impactful works produced in each career. In a sequence of N works by an individual,
we denote with N ∗ the position of the highest impact work within a career, N ∗∗ the second high-

3

est and N ∗∗∗ the third. We find each of the three highest impact works occurs randomly within a
career (Fig. S4). That is, when it comes to any of the three most expensive artworks by an artist,
three highest rated movies by a director, and three highest impact publications by a scientist, each
of them is randomly distributed among all the works one produces. These results offer strong endorsement for the random impact rule13, 23, 24 , hence supporting an unpredictable view of individual
creativity.

Yet, as we show next, the random impact rule observed across creative careers is only apparent, because the timing between creative works follows highly predictable patterns. Indeed,
we measure the correlation between the timing of the two biggest hits within a career (e.g., N ∗
and N ∗∗ ) by calculating the joint probability P (N ∗ , N ∗∗ ), and compare it with a null hypothesis in which N ∗ and N ∗∗ each occurs at random. We find that, the normalized joint probability,
φ(N ∗ , N ∗∗ ) = P (N ∗ , N ∗∗ )/(P (N ∗ )P (N ∗∗ )), is significantly overrepresented along the diagonal
elements of matrices (Figs. 1a–c), demonstrating that N ∗ and N ∗∗ are much more likely to colocate
with each other than what we would expect from the random impact model. Moreover, the colocation pattern is universal across a wide range of careers we studied, including artists (Fig. 1a),
movie directors (Fig. 1b) and scientists (Fig. 1c). The diagonal pattern disappears if we shuffle
the order of works within each career, thereby breaking the temporal correlations between highest
impact works while preserving the random impact rule (Figs. 1d–f, Fig. S6).

To quantify the temporal colocation of hits observed in Figs. 1a–c, we calculate the distance between two highest impact works for every individual, measured by the number of works

4

) of real careers with PS ( ∆N
) of shufproduced in between, ∆N = N ∗ − N ∗∗ . We compare P ( ∆N
N
N
) = P ( ∆N
)/PS ( ∆N
). For artists, movie directors, and scientists,
fled careers by defining R( ∆N
N
N
N
R( ∆N
) all exhibits a clear peak centering around zero and decays quickly as ∆N deviates from
N
zero (Figs. 1j–l). Indeed, the two most important works of an artist is 1.48 times more likely to occur back-to-back than expected by chance (Fig. 1j). The same is true for movie directors (Fig. 1k)
and scientists (Fig. 1l), where such colocation is 1.42 and 1.57 times more likely than their baseline
) is mostly
occurrence rate, respectively. Also important to note is the interesting fact that R( ∆N
N
symmetric around zero (Figs. 1j–l), indicating a comparable likelihood for the biggest hit to arrive
before or after the second biggest for all three types of careers. This symmetry was also captured
by Figs. 1a–c, where φ features a roughly even split across the diagonal. The colocation patterns
documented in Figs. 1a–c and 1j–l are not limited to the two highest impact works within a career. Indeed, we repeated our analyses for other pairs of hit works, such as N ∗ vs. N ∗∗∗ and N ∗∗
vs. N ∗∗∗ , uncovering the same colocation patterns (Figs. 1j–l and Fig. S5).

Do high impact works come in streaks within a career? To answer this question, we count the
number of consecutive works whose goodness exceeds a certain threshold across various careers
(Figs. 1m–o). Here we choose the median goodness of all works within a career as the threshold.
We calculate the length of the longest streak L for each career, and measure the distribution of
L across our user base in each of the three domains. We then shuffle the order of works within
each career, and measure again their longest streaks Ls . We find P (L) is characterized by a much
longer tail, compared with P (Ls ) (Figs. 1p–r), indicating real careers are characterized by long
streaks of excellent works clustered together in sequence. Note that for the three types of careers,
5

the tail part of both P (L) and P (Ls ) follows approximately an exponential function, meaning that
the likelihood to observe a longer streak diminishes rather rapidly. Hence, the deviations observed
between P (L) and P (Ls ) are rather significant (Fig. S11). To test the robustness of these results,
we repeated our analyses by controlling for individual career length, and also varying our threshold
used to calculate L, finding our conclusions remain the same (Supplementary Information S2.4 and
S2.5).

Taken together, results presented in Fig. 1 paint a rather unexpected portrait of individual
careers. Indeed, while the timing of high impact works each appears at random by itself, their
relative timing, however, follows highly reproducible yet previously unknown patterns. As such,
individual careers are far from being random, but characterized by bursts of high-impact works
occurring in sequence. These fascinating empirical findings raise an important question: What are
the mechanisms responsible for the temporal regularities observed across diverse career histories?

To unearth the fundamental mechanisms governing the patterns documented in Fig. 1, let us
first consider a null model in which the goodness of works produced in a career (i.e.. log(price)
for artists, ratings for directors, and log(C10 ) for scientists) is drawn from a normal distribution
N (Γi , σi2 ), fixed for an individual. The average Γi characterizes typical impact of works produced
by the individual, and σi captures the variance. This null model reproduces the fact that each
hits occur randomly within a career13, 23 and the differences in typical impact between careers
(Supplementary Information S3.2, Figs. S25–S27). Yet it fails to capture any of the temporal
correlations observed in Fig. 1. The main reason is illustrated in Figs. 2a–c, where we selected for

6

illustration purposes one individual from each of the three datasets and measure the dynamics of Γi
during his/her career. We find Γi is not constant throughout a career. Rather, it features deviations
from a baseline performance (Γ0 ) at a certain point of a career (t↑ ), elevating to a higher value
ΓH (ΓH > Γ0 ), which is then sustained for some time before falling back to a similar level as Γ0
(Figs. 2a–c):

otherwise

This observation, combined with the shortcomings of the null model, raises an intriguing hypothesis: Could a simple model based on (1) explain the temporal anomalies documented in Fig. 1?

To test this hypothesis, we apply (1) to real productivity patterns of an individual, allowing us
to generatively simulate impacts of the works produced by an individual (Supplementary Information S3.3). As an individual’s baseline performance is captured by Γ0 , during the period in which
ΓH operates (t↑ ≤ t ≤ t↓ ), the individual seemingly performs at a higher level than her typical
performance (Γ0 ), prompting us to call this model, the hot-streak model, and correspondingly, the
ΓH period as the hot streak. Hence, in the hot-streak model, the goodness of works produced by an
individual is drawn from two distributions N (Γ0 , σ 2 ) and N (ΓH , σ 2 ), depending on whether the
individual is within the hot streak. We introduce to each career one ho t streak that occurs at random
with a fixed duration and magnitude, and repeat our measurements in Fig. 1 on careers generated
by the model. We find, while equation (1) only introduces a simple temporal variation, surprisingly
the hot-streak model is sufficient in reproducing all empirical observations that existing modeling
frameworks fail to account for from the temporal colocations among top hit works within a career
7

(Figs. 1g–i), to their temporal distances (Figs. 1j–l), to the occurrences of long streaks of excellent
works (Figs. 1p–r). For full comparisons with existing models, see Supplementary Information S4.
Equation (1) assumes implicitly each individual has one hot streak, a hypothesis that we test later.
Given the myriad factors that can affect career impacts12–16, 23, 25, 32, 33 , and the obvious diversity of
careers we studied, the level of universality and accuracy demonstrated by the simple hot-streak
model is rather unexpected.

The real value of the model arises, however, when we fit the model to real careers to obtain
the individual specific Γ0 , ΓH , t↑ and t↓ parameters (Supplementary Information S3.4), allowing
us to probe quantitatively the hot streak phenomenon underlying artistic, cultural, and scientific
careers, and helping us reveal several fundamental patterns governing individual careers:

1. The hot streak is ubiquitous across careers, yet at the same time rather unique within a career.
We find, the vast majority of artists (91%, Fig. 2d), movie directors (82%, Fig. 2e) and
scientists (90%, Fig. 2f) have at least one hot streak throughout their careers, documenting
the practical relevance of the uncovered hot streak phenomenon. Yet, despite its ubiquity, the
hot streak is most likely to be unique within a career. Indeed, we relax our fitting algorithm to
allow for multiple hot streaks (up to three) with different values of ΓH , finding that, among
those who have a hot streak, 64% of artists, 80% of directors, and 68% of scientists are
best captured by one hot streak only (Figs. 2d–f), documenting the precious nature of hot
streaks. Second acts may occur but less likely, particularly for movie directors. About 30%
of artists and scientists have two hot streaks, but only 11% for directors. Occurrences of
8

more than two hot streaks are rare across all careers. We also find that, between those who
have one or two hot streaks, there is no detectable difference in terms of typical performance
metrics, including impact, productivity and career length (Fig. S22), suggesting that hot
streaks capture an orthogonal dimension to current metrics characterizing individual careers.
2. The hot streak occurs randomly within a career. We estimate the beginning of hot streaks
for artistic, cultural, and scientific careers. Denoting with N↑ , the position of work produced
when the hot streak starts (t↑ ), we find that N↑ is randomly distributed in the sequence of N
works within a career (Figs. 2g–i). This finding reconciles two seemingly divergent schools
of thought12, 13, 23 , providing a further explanation for the random impact rule: If the hot
streak occurs randomly within a career, and the highest impact works are statistically more
likely to appear within the hot streak, then the timing of the highest impact works would also
appear random.
3. Across different domains, a hot streak lasts for a considerably shorter period comparing with
the typical career length recorded in our database. We measure the duration distribution
of hot streaks (τH = t↑ − t↓ ), finding P (τH ) peaks around 5.7 years for artists, 5.2 years
for directors, and 3.7 years for scientists (Figs. 2j–l). Interestingly, the duration of a hot
streak is independent of when it occurs within a career (early, mid or late career, Figs. 2j–l).
The temporally localized nature of hot streaks is also captured by its proportion over career
length τH /T (Figs. 2j–l, insets), whose median hovers around 20% (0.17 for artists, 0.23 for
directors, and 0.20 for scientists).
4. How much does an individual deviate from her typical performance during hot streaks?
9

Do people with higher Γ0 also experience more performance gain from hot streaks? To
answer these questions, we explore correlations between Γ0 and ΓH , finding them to be well
approximated by a linear relationship across three kinds of careers (Figs. 2m–o). Hence
the better typical performance, the better individuals perform during their hot streaks. It
is interesting to note that the coefficients are slightly less than 1 (0.99 for artists, 0.85 for
directors, and 0.9 for scientists, Figs. 2m–o). Hence ∆Γ ≡ ΓH − Γ0 decreases with Γ0
(Figs. 2m–o insets), suggesting individuals with smaller Γ0 benefit more from hot streaks.
These results are again independent of when hot streaks occur along a career (Figs. 2m–o).
5. Are individuals more productive during hot streaks? Surprisingly, the answer is no. We
measure the distribution of the total number of works produced during hot streaks P (NH ).
We then construct a null distribution, by randomly picking one work out of a career and
designating its production year to be the start of the hot streak. We find P (NH ) measured
in real careers well aligns with the null model’s predictions for all three kinds of careers
(Figs. 2p–r). Therefore, individuals show no detectable change in productivity during hot
streaks, despite the fact that their outputs during the period are significantly better than typical, suggesting an endogenous shift in individual creativity when a hot streak occurs.

What is the impact of hot streaks on individual careers? To answer this question, we focus
on scientific careers (D3 ), and measure the collective impact of a scientist, g(t), defined as the
total number of citations over time collected by all the papers one published. Brought to spotlight
by popular websites such as Google Scholar (Fig. 3a), g(t) is playing an increasingly important

10

role in driving many critical decisions, from hiring, promotion and tenure to awarding of grants
and rewards. Next we show the collective impact of an individual is fundamentally governed by
the uncovered hot streak phenomenon, ignoring which would lead us to systematically under- or
over-estimate the future impact of a scientist.

Many factors are known to influence the collective impact of a career, ranging from productivity15, 22, 34
to citation disparity and dynamics17, 18, 21, 25, 27, 35 to temporal inhomogeneities along a career14, 22–25, 36 .
Since our goal is to understand impact, here we bypass the need to evaluate the inhomogeneous
nature of productivity22, 23 by rearranging publication time of each paper, such that an individual
produces a constant number of papers each year, denoted by n (Figs. 3b–c). To calculate g(t) analytically, we need to incorporate papers’ citation patterns into our hot-streak model (1). A recent
study21 suggests that citation dynamics of a paper published at time t0 can be approximated by

where m is a global parameter describing the typical number of references a paper contains, and
Φ(·) is the cumulative normal function, characterized by µ and σ, which capture the typical citation
life cycle of a paper. The paper’s impact is ultimately determined by its fitness21 , λ. To adapt this
model into our framework, we replace λ with Γ(t0 ), and for simplicity assume µ and σ are fixed
for different papers published by an individual. The resulting model, combining (1) and (2), can be
solved analytically (Supplementary Information S5.1–S5.4), allowing us to express g(t) in terms

Equation (3) consists of two terms. g0 (t) captures a career’s collective impact in the absence of

hot streaks (i.e. Γ(t) = Γ0 ). Contributions from hot streaks are encoded in ∆g(t), driven by both
the timing and magnitude of hot streaks (t↑ , t↓ , ΓH , and ΓH − Γ0 ). Varying hot streak parameters
significantly alters the collective impact of a career (Fig. 3d).

We adopt two measures to quantify the accuracy of our model (3). To account for the inherently noisy career trajectories, we first assign an impact envelope to each individual, explicitly
quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Information S5.6). We
measure the fraction of g(t) that fall within the envelope, finding the distribution across individuals peaks close to 1 (Fig. 3f), indicating most career trajectories are well encapsulated within the
predicted envelopes. The superior accuracy of our model is also captured by the Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) (Fig. 3g), with improvement being most pronounced for an early onset of
a hot streak (Fig. 3g), which is also correctly predicted by our model. Hence the hot-streak model
captures a wide range of trajectories that collective impacts of scientific careers follow (Fig. 3h).

The observed accuracy prompts us to ask whether the hot-streak model is unique in its ability
12

to capture the impact of individual careers across diverse domains. There are several alternative hypotheses capturing different hot streak dynamics (Supplementary Information S6), each associated
with possible origins of the uncovered hot streak phenomena: (A) A right trapezoid (Fig. S32b)
captures a sudden onset of the hot streak with a more gradual decline, as innovators may stumble
upon a groundbreaking idea, which manifests itself in the forms of multiple artworks, movies, and
publications. Hence from an evolutionary perspective, the duration of hot streaks may characterize time it takes for the temporary competitive advantage to dissipate. (B) An isosceles trapezoid
model (Fig. S32c) captures a hot streak that evolves and dissolves gradually over time, which may
approximate social tie dynamics, as one individual’s hot streak could be the result of a fruitful, repeated collaboration32, 37 . (C) Furthermore, individual performance may peak at a certain point of
a career, prompting us to test inverted-U shape (Fig. S32d) and tent functions (Fig. S32e). Lastly
(D) a left trapezoid function (Fig. S32f) captures a gradual startup period with a sharp cutoff,
corresponding to career opportunities that can augment impact but last for a fixed duration.

We tested hypotheses A–D systematically to describe real careers (Supplementary Information S6). Of all hypotheses considered, the proposed hot-streak model is the simplest and least
flexible. Yet, surprisingly, it is the only model whose predictions are consistent with real careers
(Fig. S32). The fact that none of the alternative hypotheses alone can fully account for empirical observations demonstrates the hot streak phenomena uncovered in creative careers may not be
driven by one particular factor but a combination of multiple factors. Identifying its true origin
requires additional experimentation and goes beyond the scope of this work. As such, hot streaks
uncovered in this paper should be treated in a metaphorical sense, highlighting an intriguing period
13

of outstanding performance tracing individual careers without implying any associated drivers for
the phenomena. Yet, crucially, the findings presented in this paper hold the same, regardless of the
underlying drivers.

The analytical framework presented here not only offers a new theoretical basis for our quantitative understanding of dynamical patterns governing individual career impact, it also has policy
implications for comparing and evaluating scientists (Fig. S30). Indeed, for individuals whose hot
streaks are yet to come, ignoring hot streaks may lead to underestimating their impacts (Figs. S30a–
b), especially given the ubiquitous nature of hot streaks (Fig. 2f). On the other hand, an early onset
of hot streaks leads to a high impact that peaks early but may not sustain unless a second act occurs (Fig. S30c). Given that individuals improve substantially during hot streaks, the uncovered
hot streak phenomenon can be particularly crucial for decisions and policies concerning long-term
impact of a career.

Figure 1: The hot streak phenomenon in artistic, cultural and scientific careers. a–c, φ(N ∗ , N ∗∗ ),
color coded, measures the joint probability of the top two highest impact works within a career for
a artists, b directors, and c scientists. φ(N ∗ , N ∗∗ ) > 1 indicates two hits are more likely to colocate than random. d–f, we shuffle the order of each work in a career while keeping their impact
intact, allowing us to measure the null hypothesis of φ(N ∗ , N ∗∗ ) across three domains, where N ∗
and N ∗∗ each occurs at random. The diagonal patterns in a–c disappear for shuffled careers. g–i,
φ(N ∗ , N ∗∗ ) predicted by the hot-streak model successfully recovers the diagonal patterns observed
in a–c. j–l, R( ∆N
) measures the temporal distance between highest impact works relative to null
N
model’s prediction. Red dots denote measurements from data, showing a clear peak around 0.
Solid lines in red are predictions by the hot-streak model. Different shades of red correspond to
different pairs of hit works. Blue dots denote the same measurement but on shuffled careers, and
blue lines are predictions from shuffled careers generated by our model. m–o, Definitions of the
longest streak L within a career for m artists, n directors and o scientists. L measures as the
maximum number of consecutive works whose impacts are above the median impact of a career
(horizontal dashed line denoting the threshold). Above the threshold, dots are colored in orange,
and blue for below the threshold. L in the lower panel highlights the longest streak in a career. p–r,
The distribution of the length of streaks P (L) for real careers and P (Ls ) for shuffled careers, for
p artists, q directors and r scientists. Red dots capture empirical observations, whereas blue dots
correspond to shuffled careers. Our hot-streak model (red lines) closely reproduces P (L) observed
in data, demonstrating the model’s validity to capture the impact beyond top three highest impact
19

works across different domains. The shuffled version of our model (blue lines) also well captures
shuffled careers.

7.0 years for directors, and 4.8 years for scientists, respectively. Inset, relative duration distribution P (τH /T ) for individuals in three domains, where T is the career length of each individual.
Solid lines are lognormal fits as guide to the eye. m–o, The relationship between ΓH and Γ0 for m
artists, n directors and o scientists, where the blue background denotes kernel density of data, dots
represent binning results of data, and the red line depicts the linear fit. Within each domain, ΓH
and Γ0 for individuals with early, middle, and late hot streaks can be well approximated by a linear
relationship. Inset, the relationship between ∆Γ (= ΓH − Γ0 ) and Γ0 for each domain. p–r, The
distribution of the number of works produced during hot streaks P (NH ), compared with a null distribution, where we randomly pick one work as the start of the hot streak (p artists, q directors, and

20

r scientists.) We use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) measure to compare P (NH ) of data with the
null distribution, finding that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the two distributions are drawn
from the same distribution (p > 0.05).

Data Description

In this project, we compiled a comprehensive database consisting of three large-scale datasets of
individual careers across three different domains: Dataset D1 contains profiles of artists obtained
from online auction databases. Dataset D2 contains profiles of movie directors recorded in the
IMDB database. Dataset D3 contains the publication and citation records of individual scientists,
obtained by combining Google Scholar and Web of Science. In this section we describe in detail
how we collected and reconstructed individual career histories for the three datasets.

S1.1

Artists D1 Among the three domains we analyzed, the success of artists is probably the

most difficult to quantify, hence unsurprisingly the least studied. Indeed, apriori, it may seem that
the success of an artist is inherently unquantifiable. Yet more recent developments start to suggest
that several measures have the potential to be systematically collected and can be used to measure
and compare the impact of artworks20 . The various measures include auction hammer prices,
being selected as illustrations in art textbooks, retrospective exhibitions, museum collections and
exhibitions. Just like citations—which have by now been commonly adopted to quantify success
of a paper and scientist, despite the fact that they offer at best an incomplete measure of impact
that is inherently multi-faceted—these measures of artistic success each capture at best a singular
dimension that is to certain degree correlated with the overall “goodness” of an artwork, with their
associated limitations (Sec. S1.4). Among all measures, hammer prices are the most commonly
used to quantify artistic success20 , perhaps because they reflect the values of artworks judged by
art professionals and art markets, serving as a proxy for the impact of artworks. While there are

4

studies showing the career trajectories of artists are rather robust against different measurement
choices20, 38 , here to ensure our findings are consistent with the state of art, we seek to collect
systematically hammer prices of artworks from different sources to reconstruct artistic careers.

We collected information on artistic careers from online art market databases, Artprice1 and
Findartinfo2 . Both websites offer a comprehensive list of auction records for each artists, with
complementary information on various kinds of fine arts ranging from old masters to contemporary
art. Indeed, auction records on Artprice offer several useful information that can help quantify
artistic careers, including, for each artwork, its auction date, title, year of production, medium, and
the price rank among all hammer prices of artworks produced by an artist. Findartinfo contains
information on auction date, title, medium, and the actual hammer price for each auction. In
this study, we combined the two data sources, allowing us to extract the most comprehensive
information tracing individual artistic careers.

Artworks can go through multiple auctions. Artprice website contains auction records from
1983 up to now, helping us ensure that we analyze the latest sales of each artwork. Findartinfo
also offers auction records from 2001 till 2015, including the actual hammer price for each record,
allowing for cross check and references. Both databases are excellent in their longitudinality,
containing artworks produced dating back to the Middle Ages.

In total, we collected 31,101 individual profiles from Artprice and 283,839 profiles from
1

www.findartinfo.com

5

Findartinfo. Artprice indexed a large number of artists, but here we focused on the top ones with
more than 50 records. We conducted a comprehensive entity linking process between the two
databases, aiming to match each artist in Artprice with the corresponding profile in Findartinfo.
We ignore profiles from the two databases noted as “attributed to” or “attrib.”, since these notions
suggest sellers are not clear about the authorship of these artworks. We then cluster remaining
profiles with the same last name together in each database, allowing us to match artists within a
small subset for computational efficiency. We compare each artist’s profile in Artprice with each
profile in Findartinfo with the same last name. Two artists are considered to be the same if they
satisfy the following criteria: 1) Initials of the first names are the same. If full names are available
for both artists, they have to be identical; 2) They have at least one artwork with an identical title;
3) If more than one artists meet criteria 1) and 2), we pick the one with most matched titles. By
applying this entity resolution procedure, we end up with a total of 5,352 matched artists. To
evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm in linking the two databases, we compare the number of
works for all matched artists in Findartinfo and Artprice in the same period (2001–2015), finding
the number of works in the two databases to be similar (Fig. S1).

After linking the two databases, we reconstruct the career histories of artists based on the
production year of each work and its hammer price during most recent auction. If an artwork is
included in the original Findartinfo dataset, the actual hammer price is used to measure the impact
of the artwork. If an artwork is only included in the Artprice dataset, we know the price rank of the
artwork among all artworks by the artist. Hence if we need to compute the actual hammer price,
we can convert sales rank using rank-to-score conversion given the price distribution measured
6

in Findartinfo39 . Note that, the uncovered hot streaks documented in the main text (Fig. 1) are
independent of whether we use price or rank because the choice does not affect the measurements
of relative positions between hit works within each individual. When an artwork was produced
during several years, we use the last year as its year of production, corresponding to the year in
which the work was finalized. For our final dataset, we selected artists with at least 15 works and
10 years of career length, resulting in 3,480 artists, with careers dating back to as far as 1460.

S1.2

Movie directors D2 The Internet Movie Database (IMDB)3 is the largest movie database

around the world, containing information about over one million movies, spanning over 20 genres
from 1874 to present. Each movie in the database includes detailed information such as title,
release time, casts, crews, an average user rating and the number of votes. IMDB also contains
over eight million personal profiles with unique identifiers, each containing personal information, a
list of works she was involved in, and specific roles in these works, such as being a director, editor,
writer, actress, etc. Although a movie is inherently a product of complex collaborative efforts often
involving a large number of individuals, the director of the movie is commonly considered to play
a prominent role in cinematic creativity40, 41 .

To this end, we gathered 513,306 movie records and profiles of 20,592 directors from IMDB,
including those who serve as an assistant director and art director. IMDB provides a rating system
for each movie that ranges from one to ten, reflecting the “crowd wisdom” of users, adjusted by
the weighting algorithms developed by IMDB to avoid vote stuffing. Previous work has found
3

http://www.imdb.com/interfaces/

7

that metrics quantifying the impact of a movie largely correlate with each other30 . Here, we use
the IMDB rating to approximate the impact of a movie, and construct the sequence of works with
their impacts for each director in our dataset. We focused on movies released before 2017 with
more than 5 votes. To select directors with long enough career histories, we focused on those who
have at least 15 movies and 10 years of career length, resulting in a total of 6,233 directors, whose
careers dating back to as far as 1890 (D2 ).

S1.3

Scientists D3 For studies on scientific careers, automated name disambiguation in large-

scale scholarly datasets remains a challenging problem42, 43 . In this study we perform a large-scale
disambiguation effort by combining two large datasets, Google Scholar (GS) and Web of Science
(WoS). Google offers scholar profile services for individuals scientists to create, maintain, and
update their own publication records, assisted by its disambiguation algorithms. Users can adjust
the publication records recommended by Google, further ensuring the accuracy and reliability of
each profile. Hence, GS offers a comprehensive dataset of individual scientific profiles across
different domains that should be at least as accurate as the state of the art, with additional two
levels of assurance. As such it has the potential to catalyze more and more research on scientific
careers23, 44, 45 .

To this end, we crawled over 240,000 public profiles from GS in summer 2015. Each GS
profile contains the publication records of a scientist, including for each paper its title, publication
year, journal, author(s) and cumulative citation count within GS database calculated up to the point
when the data was collected. GS encourages users to enter other information including affiliation,

8

research interest, homepage, and collaborators. Users with verified academic email address are
noted in their GS pages. Here, we choose those with verified email address and co-authors as they
are considered well-maintained. We further remove individuals with more than 1,000 publications
in GS, finding most of them have Asian names which are the most difficult to disambiguate. Here
again the goal is to follow closely the same procedures used by existing studies in this area23, 44, 45 ,
so that every finding in our paper is immediately comparable with previous literature to ensure our
results are consistent hence new findings reliable given the existing literature.

Since GS only provides the cumulative citation count of each paper by the time of data
collection, to study the dynamical impact of each scientist we linked GS with the WoS dataset,
which provides comprehensive citation records of around 46 million journal papers published after
1900. For each scientist, we match each publication in her GS profile with the corresponding paper
in WoS. We conducted a comprehensive linkage process that takes into account not only the author
name and paper title, but also the metadata available for each publication. For each scientist in
GS we first consider a pool of WoS papers having an author with the same last name. Then for
each publication in her GS profile, we calculated the cosine similarity between the title of each GS
record and each WoS paper in the subset. We then consider a record in GS profile matched with
a WoS publication if the following criteria are met: 1) The WoS paper was published within ±2
years of the GS publication year; 2) There is at least one co-author sharing the same last name
in GS and WoS if the paper has more than one authors; 3) The cosine similarity between titles
is higher than 0.5 after removing stop words. If there are multiple papers, we choose the one
with the most similar title (highest cosine similarity). If, using these criteria, we could not find a
9

corresponding paper in WoS, we consider the GS record is not matched to ensure the quality of
the resulting dataset. We choose scientists with at least 15 papers and 20 years of career length,
resulting in 20,040 profiles for our analyses (D3 ).

To approximate the impact of each paper, we follow recent studies17, 21, 23 to calculate the
number of citations the paper received after 10 years of publication C10 . Previous studies have
shown that for WoS dataset the average citation counts of a paper increase over time18, 23, 46 , which
we verified to be the case for our dataset (Fig. S2). To make sure our results are not affected by
this temporal effect, we follow previous studies18, 23 and use a rescaled C10 , defined as C10 /hC10 iy ,
to gauge the impact of a paper, where hC10 iy is the average impact of all papers in WoS published
in the same year y. We report in S2 and Fig. 1 the results based on the rescaled C10 . We find the
use of raw or rescaled C10 does not alter our conclusions.

S1.4

Data Limitations Although the datasets curated in our study are among the largest col-

lections of individual careers, our data are not without limitations. While auction data are most
commonly used to quantify impact of an artwork, it is important to understand a potential bias
involved in using auction data to measure and compare the relative value of an artwork20 . This
issue is of particular relevance for famous artists, whose work is eagerly sought after by museums.
While museums sometimes take part in auctions, they are in general less likely to sell a collection.
The “museum bias” may also affect works differently. For example, if we consider the probability
that an oil painting may be owned by a museum, late paintings tend to have a higher probability
than early paintings. Also museums may not take paintings randomly from a career, but are rather

10

biased toward the best works. Hence the hits we observed in some careers may represent a lower
bound of the real number of hits. But thankfully, we find our results are rather robust when we vary
the threshold for hits. Despite these limitations, one possible reason why auction prices remain the
best measures to quantify the importance of artworks is rooted in the fact that they are significantly
better than alternatives. For example, other measures like museum exhibitions mainly focus on
masterpieces of famous artists, limiting the scope and data availability for quantitative analysis.

Datasets about movies and scientific publications are more frequently studied quantitatively
than artworks, hence the metrics used in those cases are better defined. But it is still important
to remember that similar biases also exist. For example, the IMDB rating could be biased toward
the judgement of general audience, whereas professional film critics may have different opinions.
Papers could be highly cited for many reasons. There are many scientific discoveries that are
ground-breaking but have few citations.

Lastly, for any study regarding individual careers, name disambiguation is always an issue
that should not be overlooked. For the three domains analyzed here, name disambiguation issues
may potentially affect results regarding artists and scientists, but less so for movie directors, as
they are associated with unique identifiers. Another issue when studying individual careers is that,
as we need enough records to study each individual, the insights obtained are inherently biased
towards productive individuals who have produced much with long enough careers.

Amid all the limitations described in this section, it should be clear, however, that these
limitations are by no means unique to our study; Rather, they apply to most, if not all studies in
11

this domain. In many ways, research progress on individual careers is hindered by the inherent
difficulties to collect and curate high-resolution individual career histories from diverse domains.
Hence another contribution of our paper is to make available to broad research communities the
comprehensive datasets we collected in this paper. By doing so, the hope is that these datasets
could be an important asset for researchers from many different disciplines as they significantly
improve the data-scarce situation, allowing researchers to build and develop new findings. To this
end, we created a dedicated website to host datasets and descriptions, with the hope to update them
as they develop. The website can be access here http://personal.psu.edu/ lpl5107/data/data/data/.

S2.1

Empirical Measurements

Impact distribution We use auction hammer price, IMDB rating, and paper citation in 10

years C10 , to approximate the impact of works for artists, movie directors, and scientists, respectively.. To study the work impact across three domains, we measure the distribution of hammer
prices, IMDB ratings and paper citation count in our datasets, finding they follow quite different
distributions. The hammer price for all artworks in our dataset can be approximated by a lognormal distribution (Fig. S3a) following
(log x−µ)2
1
e− 2σ2
P (x) = √
x 2πσ

(S1)

We fit Eq. S1 to P (price) measured from data, and obtain the estimated parameters µ = 7.91 and
σ = 1.55. Similarly, we find the distribution for both raw and rescaled C10 in our dataset also
follows a log-normal distribution (Figs. S3c–d), which is consistent with previous studies17, 18, 23 .
In contrast, the IMDB rating follows a normal distribution ranging between 1 and 10 (Fig. S3b).
12

Hence, to study the impact across three domains, we define a goodness parameter Γ for artists,
directors and scientists as log(price), IMDB ratings and log(C10 ), respectively.

S2.2

Random impact rule One school of thought on the lifecycle of creative careers suggests

a hit work within individual career is largely driven by chance, having a constant probability to
appear in unit of works within each career13, 23, 47, 48 . To verify this hypothesis in our dataset, we
study the position N i of each top i highest-impact work in the sequence of N works within each
career, and measure the complementary cumulative distribution function P (≥ N i /N ) within the
sequence of works produced by individuals in different domains. We find for each of the top 3
hit works in an artistic career, P (≥ N i /N ) decreases linearly as (N i /N )−1 , corresponding to
a uniform P (N i /N ) (Fig. S4a), suggesting the most expensive works of an artists is randomly
distributed within her career. Similarly, we find the same pattern of P (≥ N i /N ) for directors and
scientists (Figs. S4b–c), suggesting the highest rated movies and the most cited papers also appear
randomly within each career. Hence, random impact rule applies across three domains.

S2.3 Φ for other pairs of hit works In the main text, we observed the normalized joint probability Φ(N ∗ , N ∗∗ ) is overrepresented along the diagonal for artists, directors and scientists, suggesting the colocation of the top two hit works within a career. To study if the colocation applies to
other pairs of hit works, we calculate the normalized joint probability Φ(N ∗ , N ∗∗∗ ) for the highest
and third highest impact works, and Φ(N ∗∗ , N ∗∗∗ ) for the second and third highest impact works
within each career across three domains. We first measure Φ(N ∗ , N ∗∗∗ ) and Φ(N ∗∗ , N ∗∗∗ ) in real
careers (Fig. S5), finding a similar diagonal pattern for Φ(N ∗ , N ∗∗∗ ) and Φ(N ∗∗ , N ∗∗∗ ), indicating

13

the temporal collocation applies to other pairs of hit works. Φ(N ∗ , N ∗∗∗ ) and Φ(N ∗∗ , N ∗∗∗ ) both
feature an even split across the diagonal, suggesting the equal probability of each hit to appear
before or after another hit. We find the colocation of other pairs of hit works is less significant than
the top two hits (lighter color along the diagonal), which is also consistent with the lower peak
value of R(∆N/N ) in Figs. 1j–l. However, if we shuffle the order of works within each career
while keeping their impact intact, the diagonal pattern of Φ(N ∗ , N ∗∗∗ ) and Φ(N ∗∗ , N ∗∗∗ ) disappears across three domains (Fig. S6), suggesting the colocation of any pair of hit works observed
in data cannot be explained by the random impact rule.

S2.4

Measurement under different career length The empirical observations in Fig. 1 are

based on artists and directors with at least 10 years of career length, and scientists with at least 20
years of career length. To study if the random impact rule and the temporal correlation of hit works
is influenced by the career length we measured, we selected two groups of individuals with longer
career length in each domain: artists with at least 20 and 30 years of career length, directors with at
least 20 and 30 years of career length, and scientists with at least 30 and 40 years of career length,
and repeated the empirical measurements on the random impact rule and the temporal colocation
for the two groups of individuals in each domain. First, we find the P (≥ N i /N ) still follows
a uniform distribution given different career length for artists, directors and scientists (Fig. S7),
suggesting the random impact rule is independent of the career length we measured. Second, we
calculate the temporal distance R(∆N ∗ /N ) for the hit and second hit within a career, where ∆N ∗
is defined as N ∗ − N ∗∗ . We find R(∆N ∗ /N ) peaks around zero featuring a symmetric split along
the x-axis (Fig. S8), suggesting the colocation of hit works is not influenced by career length.
14

Third, we find the tail of both P (L) and P (LS ) follows an exponential distribution. P (L) features
a much wider than P (LS ) (Fig. S9), suggesting the long streaks sustain in careers of different
length.

S2.5 P (L) under different threshold We have studied the streak of works above the median
impact within a career in Fig. 1, finding P (L) observed in real careers has a longer tail than that
of shuffled careers. To test if the conclusion is robust to different choices of impact threshold, we
changed the threshold to the mean impact and geometric mean of impact within each career for
artists, directors, and scientists. We find similar results for P (L) and P (LS ) given different impact
threshold.

S2.6

Difference between P (L) and P (LS ) To quantify the different probabilities to observe

streaks for real and shuffled careers (Figs. 1p–r), we measured P (L)/P (LS ), capturing how more
likely it is to observe streaks than random at different streak length. Since we care about the probability of long streaks, we focus on the tail of P (L) and P (LS ), and fit their tails to an exponential
distribution. We then compare the tail difference of P (L) and P (LS ) based on the fitting results
across three domains (Fig. S11). We find for artists and scientists, the probability for an individual
to produce consecutive 20 high impact works above the median impact within a career, is around 20
times more likely than shuffled careers. The probability is over 100 times more likely for directors.

Hot-streak Model

Hot streak studies in the literature The debate on hot streaks dates back to 1985, when

Gilovich et al. presented that the hot-hand belief on basketball players is merely a cognitive bias
of random process1 . Since then, hot hand has been widely studied in sports, financial markets
and gambling. These studies tried to answer two fundamental questions: 1) the statistical evidence
on whether the hot hand exists1–3 , and 2) the psychological origin of the hot hand belief1, 49–52 .
Here we conduct a comprehensive review of the existing literature related to the first question.
Table S1 reviews selected empirical studies of whether hot hand exists. Table S2 reviews different
mathematical models to detect hot hand. Hot hand has been measured and reported by independent
research groups, each using different datasets and statistical models mainly in sports, financial
markets and gambling. In this study, we extend the analyses on hot hand to different domains,
focusing on individual creative careers.

S3.2

Null model To uncover the regularities behind the empirical observations, we first intro-

duce a null model motivated by the random impact rule. That is, we assume each individual i
produces a sequence of N works whose impact (i.e.. log(price) for artists, ratings for directors,
and log(C10 ) for scientists) is randomly chosen from an impact distribution P (Γ) = N (Γi , σi2 ),
where Γi is a constant goodness parameter specific to each individual, and σi reflects the impact
fluctuation within each career. For simplicity, we assume σi to be the same for each individual in
a domain. The null model allows us to simulate impacts of the works produced by an individual.
For each individual, we use real productivity N as input, and assume Γi as the average impact

16

measured from each individual, and σi = 1.0 is a constant for all the individuals. We repeated the
measurements of P (≥ N i /N ) and Φ to verify its prediction on the random impact rule and the
temporal correlation, finding the null model can reproduce the random impact rule of the top three
hit works across three domains (Fig. S12), while it fails to capture any temporal clustering among
hits (Fig. S13), suggesting that there are other factors affecting individual careers.

S3.3

Generative hot-streak model The failure of the null model prompts us to abandon our

hypothesis that Γi is constant with each career. Each hit work is random while their relative position
is not, indicating the presence of a period of outstanding performance (ΓH ) that appears randomly
with a career. Using real productivity N as input, the hot-streak model allows us to generatively
simulate the impacts of the works produced by an individual. For each individual i, the impact of a
work is randomly drawn from a normal distribution N (ΓH , σi2 ) if it is produced during hot streaks,
or N (Γ0 , σi2 ) otherwise. To define a random hot streak in each career, we randomly pick one work
out of the sequence of N works she produced, and denote its year of production as t↑ , marking the
start of the hot streak. For simplicity, we assume Γ0 , ΓH , σi , and τH = t↑ − t↓ to be the same for
each individual in a domain. The result reported in Fig. 1 is based on the following parameters:
Γ0 = 6.9, σ = 1.1 and τH = 6 years for artists; Γ0 = 6.5, σ = 1.1 and τH = 6 years for directors;
and Γ0 = 3.0, σ = 1.3 and τH = 4 years for scientists, with ΓH = Γ0 + 1.0 for individuals in
all three domains. Although it is a simple generative model with four parameters, our hot-streak
model can reproduce all the empirical findings measured from a variety of individual careers.

17

S3.4

Estimation of hot streaks In order to test how well our hot-streak model matches empirical

data, we need to estimate the model parameters for each individual. We show in this section that
the impact of works within a career can be captured by a time-dependent variable Γ(N ), defined
as the average of impact calculated by rolling a window of size ∆N = max(5, 0.1NT ) over an
individuals sequence of works, where NT is the total number of works produced by an individual.
In order to capture the average performance during a period, we assume the window size to account
for 10% of all the works one produced, and set the lower bound of ∆N as 5 in order to calculate
Γ(N ) based on enough works. In order to remove any potential boundary effect, we calculate
Γ(N ) from ∆N/2, whose value is defined by the average Γ between 0 and ∆N , and then move the
sliding window one work per step until NT − ∆N/2. Γ(N ) reflects the average impact of works
between N −∆N/2 and N +∆N/2. Γ(N ) is calculate from log(price) for artists, IMDB ratings for
directors, and the raw log(C10 ) sequence for scientists. We find for scientists calculating the raw
or the rescaled C10 does not alter the trend of Γ(N ) (Fig. S14a). Indeed, we measure the Pearson
correlation between the Γ(N ) sequence calculated from raw log(C10 ) and rescaled log(C10 ) for
each individual, finding the distribution of correlation coefficient P (ρ) peaks around 1 with mean
value 0.93 (Fig. S14b), suggesting the two sequences are highly correlated and the rescale does not
change the trend of Γ(N ) in general. Since the raw log(C10 ) is easier to interpret, we report results
related to Γ(N ) based on the raw log(C10 ).

For each individual in our dataset, we use a piecewise function to fit the sequence of Γ(N )
measured from real careers. Specifically, we relax the number of hot streaks to at most three, and
allow the ΓH of each hot streak to be different. We used ordinary least square (OLS), and adopted
18

scipy.optimize package to fit the piecewise function to data. Besides, to overcome the over-fitting
problem, we added the L1 regularization term to the cost function that penalizes the number of hot
streaks. For each individual, we repeated the fitting procedures for 20 realizations, and selected the
results with the smallest cost. We show more fitting results for individuals across three domains
in Figs. S15–S17. To define the hot streak in each career, we assume the smallest fitted Γ(N ) as
Γ0 for an individual. To make sure the fitted hot streak reflects a substantial period of improved
performance, we set a threshold for both the duration and the intent of each hot streak. Specifically,
for any Γ larger than Γ0 , if the difference between the two is larger than the inherent noise within
a career (standard deviation of Γ(N )), we then define it as a hot streak. Besides, we assume ΓH
should at least last for 5 works, otherwise we think the duration is too short, and regard it an outlier
of normal performance.

S3.5

Model validation: Fitting performance To systematically evaluate the goodness of fitting

for the procedure proposed above, we measure the difference between fitted and real Γ(N ) by
calculating the coefficient of determination R2 . To study if R2 between fitted and real Γ(N ) can be
explained by the inherent noise of Γ(N ) sequence, we calculate the expected value of R2 generated
by the inherent noise of the impact sequence. To do so, we use fitted Γ(N ) as input, and simulate
the impacts of works within a career for each individual, by assuming the impact of each work is
randomly selected from a normal distributions N (ΓH , σs2 ) if it was produced during hot streaks,
or from N (Γ0 , σs2 ) otherwise. We assume σs to be the same for all individuals in a domain.
To determine the value of σs , we calculate the difference σ between the real Γ(N ) and fitted

19

Γ(N ), and measure the distribution P (σ) for all individuals in each domain. We find P (σ) follows
a normal distribution that peaks around zero for artists, directors and scientists (Fig. S18). The
standard deviation for P (σ) is 0.186 for artists, 0.229 for directors, and 0.189 for scientists. We
approximate the standard deviation for P (σ) as the noise in each domain, respectively. Using
these numbers as input, we simulated the impacts of works within a career for 1000 realizations,
allowing us to calculate a distribution P (R2 ) for each individual. To study if R2 of real and fitted
Γ(N ) can be explained by noise, we define a baseline R2 that is the lowest 5% of all simulated R2
(p-value = 0.05). If the R2 of data and fitted Γ(N ) is larger than the baseline R2 , we assume the
error is mainly generated by noise, and Γ(N ) is well captured by our hot-streak model (Fig. S19).
We find for individuals in our dataset, over 69% artists, 80% directors and 75% scientists have R2
larger than the baseline R2 , suggesting our hot-streak model captures the majority of individuals
in our dataset.

We also compared the fitting performance of our hot-streak model with the null model by
calculating adjusted R2 and Bayesian information criterion (BIC), both penalizing the number
of parameters in the model. Compared with the null model, we find our hot-streak model has
systematically larger adjusted R2 and smaller BIC for individuals across three domains (Fig. ??),
suggesting out hot-streak model better captures the dynamics of Γ(N ) than the null model.

S3.6

Model validation: Impact before and after a hot streak Our hot-streak model assumes

that after a hot streak, the individual performance returns back to her normal performance. To test
this assumption, we measure for each individual the average impact of all works produced during

20

the normal performance before and after each hot streak, where the normal performance and the
hot streak is defined by the fitted Γ(N ). We calculate the distribution of the difference between
average impact before and after the hot streak P (∆hΓi) that ∆hΓi = hΓiaf ter − hΓibef ore , finding
P (∆hΓi) follows a normal distribution peaks around zero (Fig. S20) for individuals across three
domains, suggesting there is no systematic different between the average impact before and after a
hot streak.

S3.7

Individuals with different number of hot streaks In this section, we discuss if there is

any difference among individuals with zero, one and more than one hot streaks across three domains. We first compare the distribution of average impact P (Γ), the number of works P (N ), and
the career length P (T ) for individuals with and without hot streaks, finding there is no significant
difference in terms of impact, productivity and career length between the two groups of people
(Fig. S21). However, we observe differences in the distribution of Γ0 and ΓH for individuals with
different number of hot streaks. Indeed, for scientists and directors, P (Γ0 ) is smaller for individuals with one hot streak than without hot streaks (Figs. S22b–c), and P (ΓH ) is higher for individuals
with more than one hot streaks (Figs. S22e–f), reflecting the inherent variance of impact within a
career for directors and scientists. While we find for artists the distribution P (Γ0 ) and P (ΓH ) is
the same for those who different number of hot streaks. The difference between artists and the
other two domains is probably due to the relation between Γ0 and ΓH , that it is more difficult for
individuals with high Γ0 to gain better performance during hot streaks for directors and scientists.
Hence, the number of hot streaks with a career captures an orthogonal dimension to current metrics
characterizing individual careers.
21

S3.8

The correlation between Γ0 and ΓH To avoid potential bias that our results in Figs. 3M–O

are affected by the underlying distribution of Γ0 and ΓH , we repeated our analysis on the relation of
Γ0 and ΓH by using the their percentile, finding the linear relationship between Γ0 and ΓH remains
the same for individuals across three domains (Fig. S23), suggesting our conclusion is insensitive
to the distribution of Γ0 and ΓH .

To test the significance of the correlation between Γ0 and ΓH observed in data, we propose
a null model that assumes they are uncorrelated. Specifically, we assume for the null model that
ΓH and Γ0 follow the same distribution. For a given Γ0 , ΓH is calculated as the expectation of
P (Γ) ranging from Γ0 to infinity under the null model. We find the null model prediction of ΓH
for a given Γ0 is much higher than the real ΓH , suggesting the impact during hot streaks of each
individual cannot be explained by chance, but largely depends on her normal performance.

S3.9

Discussion on scientific disciplines To compare the hot-streak properties for scientists

from different disciplines, we identify each scientist her discipline by using the scientific journal
categories provided by WoS18 . The publications collected in D3 belong to journals from 145
different categories in WoS ranging from Acoustic to Zoology. For each scientist, we count the
number of papers published in each of the 145 categories. Since a journal may belong to multiple
categories, and each category includes a list of journals, we count each paper multiple times in all
related categories. We consider the category with the most publications within a scientific career as
her research discipline. Hence, each scientist in our dataset can be only assigned to one discipline.
Here we study the top 30 disciplines with the most scientists in our datasets. We find the ratio of

22

scientists with one hot streak to be stable across disciplines, accounting for roughly 60% within
each discipline (Fig. S24a), where the ratio is highest (up to 70%) for scientists from oncology,
and the lowest (around 50%) for scientists from ophthalmology. We also calculate the average
duration of the hot streak hτH i for scientists from 30 disciplines (Fig. S24b), finding scientists
from geophysics have on average the longest hot streak (around 7.5 years), whereas scientists from
chemistry have the shortest hot streak on average (around 3 years). The robustness across different
disciplines indicates the generalizability of the hot-streak model.

S4

Relationship with Existing Models

In this section, we discuss the relationship between the proposed hot-streak model with previous studies on the individual impact. Here we will focus on the most recent model, namely the
Q-model23 . Different from the assumption that scientists with similar productivity have indistinguishable impact, the Q-model suggests the existence of a hidden parameter Q unique to each
individual. Although the hot-streak model builds upon a similar conceptual basis to the Q-model,
the main findings of our model demonstrate that the Q-model is not sufficient to capture the impact
dynamics within each career. The reason is simple: the Q-model is mainly designed to capture the
impact differences across individuals, focusing on the overall performance of an individual rather
than the how impact changes within a career, which is the focus of our paper. Next we show in this
section the mathematical consistency between our hot-streak model and the Q-model. As such,
the hot-streak model not only helps us explain the temporal regularities documented in the main
text not anticipated by the Q-model, but is also able to reproduce all the predictions the Q-model
23

makes on individual careers.

S4.1

Compare Γ and Q parameter The Q-model models the citation after 10 years C10 of a

paper α for a scientist i as the multiplication of two parts23 :
C10,iα = Qi pα ,

(S2)

where Qi is a individual-specific parameter, and pα is the luck component that is same for every
individual. The Q-model assumes Qi to be a constant over time for each individual, and pα follows
a log-normal distribution that P (log p) = N (µp , σp ) same to all scientists. Hence, we can take the
logarithms of Eq. S2 that log(C10,iα ) = log(Qi ) + log(pα ). Noting that C10 , pα and Qi all follow a
log-normal distribution, the impact of a paper produced by a scientist i is randomly drawn from a
normal distribution that
P (log C10,iα ) = N (µp + log Qi , σp ),

(S3)

whose mean value is modulated by the individual-specific Qi parameter. Comparing Eq. S3 with
the definition of Γ parameter in S2.1, we find our Γ parameter can be expressed as
Γiα = log(Qi ) + µα .

(S4)

Hence, the Γ parameter combines the two parts in the Q-model, reflecting both the individual
differences and the luck component.

The hot-streak model contains all the ingredients of the Q-model, while it also captures the
temporal colocation of hit works within a career by introducing a temporal variation of Γ, allowing
an individual to improve her typical performance (Γ0 ) to a higher level (ΓH ) for a while. With this
24

simple modification, we show, for the first time, that the dynamics of impact within an individual
career is characterized by a remarkable degree of regularity. The idea behind changing Γ0 to ΓH
is the improvement of individual skill from Qi to a higher value. It is also worth noting that the
duration of a hot streak is relatively short compared to the career length we measured, usually
lasting for 5 years or accounting for 20% works produced by a scientist. Hence, our hot-streak
model can be approximated as the Q-model in the long run. In sum, our hot-streak model is
consistent with the Q-model, in terms of the definition of Γ parameter, and the generative process
of impacts within a career.

S4.2

Q-model validation for scientists In this section, we validate the Q-model for scientists

in our dataset. We also demonstrate the hot-streak model successfully reproduces all the Q-model
predictions on the impact across scientists. To validate the Q-model in our dataset, we first calculated the distribution of impact and productivity, finding P (log(C10 )) and P (N ) both follow a
log-normal distribution that meets the assumption of the Q-model (Fig. S3c, Fig. S25a). We then
used the maximum likelihood method to estimate the parameters µ and Σ of the trivariate normal
distribution P (log p, log Q, log N ) ∼ N (µ, Σ) in the Q-model. The estimated parameters for the
joint probability P (log p, log Q, log N ) is
µ = (µp , µQ , µN ) = (1.39, 0.72, 3.43)

The matrix Eq. S5 is consistent with the Q-model that σp,Q = σp,N ≈ 0. The estimated Q parameter also follows a log-normal distribution (Fig. S25b).

The Q-model successfully explains the impact differences across individual scientists by
∗
i with productivity N and with the logarithm of the average impact
capturing the scaling of hC10
−∗ 23
without the hit hC10

the Q-model by using Eq. S5, and compared them with the empirical observations, finding the

i and N , hC10
results of the Q-model are aligned with data for the relationship between hC10
−∗
hC10

by the Q-model, we simulated the impacts of each scientists using the generative hot-streak model
−∗
∗
described in Sec. S3.3, and repeated the analyses for hC10
i between N and hC10
i. We find our

hot-streak model can also capture these the empirical observation on the impact differences across
scientists (Figs. S25c–d), suggesting our hot-streak model is consistent with the Q-model when
comparing impact across different scientists.

S4.3

Q-model validation for artists and directors To study if the Q-model can be used to

model the impacts of works for artists and movie directors, we repeated the procedures to estimate
the Q-model parameters similar to scientists. Assume the auction price of each work is generated
from the joint probability of p(p, N, Q), where p is the global distribution of price. To obtain
the parameters for p(p, N, Q), we first measured the distribution of auction price P (price) for all
works, and productivity P (N ) for all artists in our datasets, finding they both follow a log-normal
distribution (Fig. S3a, Fig. S26a). The maximum-likelihood estimation allows us to calculate the

26

parameters for the joint probability of p(p̂, N̂ , Q̂), where p̂ = log p, N̂ = log N , and Q̂ = log Q.
Similarly, we find p(p̂, N̂ , Q̂) follows a trivariate normal distribution whose
µ = (µp , µQ , µN ) = (6.5, 1.8, 4.03),

Notice that different from scientists, Q and N , N and p have positive correlations. The estimated
Q parameter follows a log-normal distribution as well (Fig. S26b), suggesting the validity of the Qmodel for artists. Besides, the Q-model predictions for artists are in agreement with data in terms of
the correlation between N and log price∗ , and the correlation between hlog price−∗ i and log price∗
(Figs. S26c–d). Hence for artists, the Q parameter can be calculated as Q = e<log price>−µprice ,
where uprice = 6.5.

Similarly, we repeated the same procedures for movie directors. We find P (rating) follows a
normal distribution and P (N ) follows a log-normal distribution (Fig. S3b, Fig. S27a), allowing us
to calculate the parameters for the joint probability p(p, N̂ , Q̂), where N̂ = log N , and Q̂ = log Q,
where p is the global distribution for ratings. p(p, N̂ , Q̂) follows a trivariate normal distribution
whose

The estimated Q parameter follows a log-normal distribution as well (Fig. S27b). The Q-model
predictions for directors slightly deviate from data in terms of the correlation between Rating∗
and N , and the correlation between hRating−∗ i and Rating∗ (Figs. S27c–d), which overestimates
Rating∗ given the same N and hRating−∗ i. We find it is probably due to the upper bound of the
IMDB rating system.

Model for Individual Collective Impact

S5.1 g(t) definition Individual collective impact, g(t), is defined as the sums of citations to all
her publications at each year that
g(t) =

N (t)
X
i=1

ci (t − ti ),

(S8)

where t measures the career stage, defined by the number of years after her first publication, N (t)
is the total number of papers published up to time t, and ti is the publication time of her ith
paper, whose yearly citations are denoted as ci . g(t) is driven by the interplay of three factors:
productivity N (t), the citation dynamics of each publication ci , and how publications and their
impacts are distributed within a career. Due to the non-uniform nature of productivity, we bypass
the need to control for N (t) to measure the career stage in unit of publications. That is, we keep
the total number of publications in 20 years NT (T = 20) of each scientist, but rearrange the
publishing process, such that a scientist produces the same number of papers every year. After this
procedure, a scientist publishes constant n papers per year, and g(t) is defined as
g(t) =

NT
X
i=1

ci (t − b

28

i
T c),
NT

(S9)

where bc means rounding down and b NiT T c denotes the publication year of the ith paper. As
a result, papers published in the late career may be shifted to early career stage, whose citation
records are not long enough to cover the rest of the time. Hence, to remove the boundary effect,
we only consider g(t) until the career stage that is not influenced by the boundary effect. The
shortest career length after adjusting the boundary effect is 16 years.

S5.2

Modulate paper citation with Γ(t) Next, we build a mathematical model for g(t) by in-

corporating our hot-streak model with paper citation dynamics. We combine Γ(t) with a previous
model describing the citation dynamics, namely the WSB model21 , allowing us to model how publications and their impacts are distributed within a career. The WSB model captures the cumulative
citation of a paper Ci (t) by three parameters: fitness λi , immediacy σi , and longevity µi that

where Γ(ti ) represents the goodness parameter when a paper was published that can be measured
from hlog(C10 )iti , where h·iti means the average around ti . The replacement is consistent with the
29

WSB model that Γ(ti ) in Eq. S12 reflect the fitness λi in the WSB model: The ultimate citation
of a paper follows C ∞ = m(eλi − 1)21 that can be approximated by C10 23 , allowing us to get
Γ(ti ) = hlog(C10 )iti ≈ hlog(C ∞ )iti ≈ log(m) + hλiti , where log(m) is a constant whose value
does not change the results of WSB model21 . Hence, Eq. S12 captures both the paper impact and
how impact distributes within career by incorporating Γ(ti ) into the WSB model.

S5.3 g(t) under the null model We first discuss the null model prediction, g0 (t), that assumes
Γ remains constant across a career (Γ(t) ≡ Γ0 ). The integral of Eq. S12 over t allows us to get the
cumulative individual citation G0 (t) that
G0 (t) =

ndt0 and n is the publication rate at each time stamp, t denotes the career stage of

a scientist, t0 is the time when each paper was published, and C(t, t0 ) is the total paper citation that
follows Eq. S12. For simplicity we assume in Eq. S13 that each scientist has constant µ and σ for
all her publications. Hence, g0 (t) can be expressed as

g0 (t) follows an S curve continuously increasing over time (Fig. 3d, Fig. S28) that is unable to
capture a variety of g(t) observed in real careers (Fig. 3d). Eq. S14 suggests g0 (t) is captured by
Γ0 and two aging effect parameters µ and σ. Comparing Eq. S12 with Eq. S14 we find g0 (t) is the
cumulative citation of papers published at t = 0.

S5.4 g(t) under hot-streak model Next we calculate g(t) under the hot-streak model by incorporating a time series Γ(t) following Eq. 1 that

Similarly, we assume a constant µ and σ for each scientist. Eq. S15 assumes each individual has

(S18)

Eq. S18 is composed of two parts: g0 (t) captures the cumulative citation of papers published when
Γ(ti ) = Γ0 , and ∆g(t) to captures the citations contributed by papers published during hot streaks
when Γ(ti ) = ΓH . Fig. 4d illustrates the influence of the hot streak on individual citation: Before
the hot streak, ∆g(t) has no impact on individual citation and g(t) = g0 (t). During the hot streak,
g(t) experiences rapid growth due to ΓH , and the trend continues for a while to reach its peak even
after the end of the hot streak. Eq. S18 allows us to model a wide range of g(t) that cannot be
expected by the null model (Fig. 3d, Fig. 3h, Fig. S29, Fig. S30). g(t) is determined by the timing
of the hot streak (t↑ and t↓ ), the level of performance (Γ0 and ΓH ), and the aging effect parameters
32

(µ and σ).

S5.5

Parameter estimation In order to test how well Eq. S18 matches empirical data, we need

to estimate the parameters Γ0 and ΓH , t↑ and t↓ , and the aging effect parameters (µ and σ) for
each scientist given her g(t). Here we assume each individual has only one hot streak, and relax
all the six individual-specific parameters. For each individual in our dataset, we used ordinary
least square (OLS) and fitted to Eq. S18 the g(t) measured from real career by minimizing the
mean squared error (MSE) between data and the model result. To make sure the fitted parameters
are meaningful, we also set constraints when optimizing the error function that t↑ > 0, t↓ > 0,
0 < Γ0 ≤ ΓH ≤ 10, 0 ≤ µ ≤ 8.5 and σ > 0. We assume ΓH cannot exceed 10, otherwise the
average citation per paper during hot streaks is hC10 i ≈ 22026.
S5.6

Model validation To systematically evaluate the accuracy of our model, we generate an

uncertainty envelop of g(t) for each individual for both the hot-streak model and the null model.
Specifically, we simulate g(t) by assigning a Gaussian noise N (0, σ 2 ) to the fitted Γ. The standard deviation σ is calculated from data (Fig. S18), representing the inherent noise of the Γ(N )
sequence. Hence, for each paper i we randomly generate a Γi parameter from a normal distribution
with mean as Γ0 if the paper is published during the normal performance or ΓH during hot streaks.
We assume µ and σ to be the same as the fitting result. We simulated each individual for 1000 realizations, allowing us to get a distribution of g(t) at each time step. The envelop at each time t is
defined as one standard deviation of all the values of g(t) at t . Then we measure the model performance by calculating the fraction of g(t) falling within the envelope. We repeated the procedures

33

for the null model to calculate the uncertainty envelope as well. Our hot-streak model outperforms
the null model as more data fall within the envelop (Fig. 3f). We also compare the distribution
of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) between data and model predictions, finding our
hot-streak model has systematically smaller error compared with the null model (Fig. S31).

S6

Testing Alternative Hypotheses

Our hot-streak model is the simplest function to approximate impacts of works within a career.
The accuracy of the hot-streak model prompts us to ask whether it is unique in its ability to capture the impacts of individual careers across different domains. We therefore seek other models
corresponding to different dynamics of hot streaks. In this section we test the validity of four alternative hypotheses (A–D) proposed in the main text (Figs. S34a–f), by comparing each model
prediction on the relative timing of the top six hit works within a carer with empirical observations.
Indeed, the symmetric patterns of normalized joint probability Φ and R(∆N/N ) for any pair of
the top three hits, suggests one hit is equal likely to appear before or after another hit among the
top three highest impact works within a career across three domains. We find such randomness on
the relative position among hits is not just limited to the top three. We measured the position of
the top three hits Ñ relative to the top six hits of the career. For each of the three hits, we compute
P (Ñ ) for artists, directors, and scientists, finding a lack of predictive patterns for P (Ñ ) across
three domains, suggesting the relative order among the top six hits in real careers are random
(Figs. S34gnu).

34

To test if hypotheses A–D can reproduce the randomness among top six hits within a career,
we then compare P (Ñ ) predicted by each hypothesis with the corresponding distributions measured from real careers. For our hot-streak model and each alternative hypothesis, we simulate a
sequence of work impact for each individual. We use real productivity N , and the mean impact of
each individual as input, and assumes for each individual a period of outstanding performance that
randomly appears within a career. We assume Γ0 for each individual as the mean impact within a
career measured from data, and ΓH = Γ0 + 1.0. Since the average length of hot streaks usually
accounts for 20% of total N works, and the alternative model only changes how the hot streak
emerges and diminishes, here we assume for each individual a fixed length of ΓH period (0.2N )
for right trapezoid, left trapezoid, and isosceles trapezoid model. We also assume the hypotenuses
of each trapezoid model to be 0.2N , ensuring the impact can gradually change between Γ0 and
ΓH under different hypotheses. To keep the duration of hot streaks to be the same for different
hypotheses, we assume a 0.4N length of hot streaks for hypothesis C and our hot-streak model,
respectively. We assume ΓH as the peak value for the quadratic and tent function of each individual. The impact of each work is then generated from a normal distribution N (Γ(N ), σ), where the
mean value Γ(N ) is defined by each model, and the standard deviation σ is measured from data
(Fig. S18).

We calculated P (Ñ ) of each hypothesis, finding P (Ñ ) for hypotheses A–D shows predictive
trends on the relative position of top six hits (Figs. S34h–m). For example, the top two hits of
isosceles trapezoid, quadratic, and tent model always appear in the middle of the top six hits, and
their probability decreases when deviating from the middle (Figs. S34j–l). For the right trapezoid
35

model, the top three hits always appear before the other hits (Fig. S34i); whereas the case reverses
for the left trapezoid model (Fig. S34m). Among these hypotheses, only our hot-streak model can
reproduce the randomness of the top six hits (Fig. S34h). To quantify the different between data
and each model prediction, we performed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to measure whether we
can reject the hypothesis that predictions and data are drawn from the same distribution. We used
the R package ‘dgof’ to conduct the discrete Goodness-of-Fit test, finding P (Ñ ) for hypotheses
A–D is statistically different from empirical observations (Figs. S34i–m). Our hot-streak model
is the only one that captures the randomness of the top six hits within a career (Fig. S34h). The
results reported in Figs. S34h–m are based on the simulations using artists’ profiles as input. To
make sure the conclusion is robust to the other two domains, we repeated the procedure using
profiles of directors (Figs. S34o–t) and scientists (Figs. S34v–aa) as input, finding the conclusion
remains the same for other domains.

Figure S32: Alternative models of hot streaks. (a–f), An illustration of Γ(N ) for the (a)
hot-streak model, (b) right trapezoid function, (c) isosceles trapezoid function, (d) quadratic
function, (e) tent function, and (f) left trapezoid function. (g), The distribution of the relative
position P (Ñ ) of the top three hit works among the top six hits within a career for artists. The
shades of color correspond to different hits.The relative position Ñ = 1 means the hit paper
appears first among the top six hit, whereas Ñ = 6 means the last one to appear. The relative
order among the top six hits are random. The conclusion remains the same for (n) directors and
(u) scientists. (h-m), P (Ñ ) predicted by corresponding model shown in (a–f) using artists’
profiles as input. We again use shades to color different hits. We measure the statistical difference
between data and the model’s predictions, using the p-value of KS test for discrete distributions.
We color the bars green if we cannot reject the hypothesis that data and model’s prediction come
from the same distributions (p-value ≥ 0.05), and color them red otherwise. Among all
alternative models considered, the hot-streak model turns out to be the only model that
successfully reproduces the randomness observed in the top six hit works in (a). While the
alternative functions show different trend of probability, contradicting to the randomness
measured from data. We repeated the analyses using (o–t) directors’ profiles and (v–aa) scientists’
profiles as input, finding our results are robust to different domains.
